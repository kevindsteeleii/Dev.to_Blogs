# Where do I start? Part 3: JavaScript
## This time
Hi all, I'm back with another installment of these lists of lists. This time around I'm talking about JavaScript. So as always, I'm just some guy and by no means an expert please **correct** me in the comments if I'm talking out of the side of my you-know-what.
## JavaScript
JavaScript is an amazing language. You can manipulate the DOM, build games, and make cool apps. There are many things you can do in this language but I'll highlight some of the things beginners need to learn and most of this will apply to other languages as well.

I said in a previous post to learn JavaScript after all the other things like HTML and CSS. But, if you really want to learn JavaScript, do so in isolation and that's how I would tell you to practice, at first. But if you're already familiar with HTML and CSS, go for it! I believe in you!

## Things to learn
There's a lot to learn in any language and it can be confusing for your first so here are some personal favorite resources on learning JavaScript.
### Topics to Study:
- **variables**, how to define them
     - let & const (**don't** use var, I mean it!!)
     - variable scope (is the variable accessible)
- **data types**
     - number, string, boolean, symbol
     - type conversion and testing, **typeof**
- **reference data types**
     - objects, arrays, etc.
- **operators**
     - addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and more!! (+, -, /, *)
- **functions**
     - a reusable piece of code that is sometimes called a procedure if it doesn't return anything, but everyone just says function, unless they're being fancy or pedantic
     - **control flow**
          - **loops**
               - for, while, for-in, for-of
          - **conditional statements**
               - if, else if, else, [try, catch, finally] -> debugging
- keyword **this**
     - **call**, **apply**, and **bind** -> when/how to use them and where
- **arrow functions**

- **DOM Manipulation**
     - create, remove, modifying an **element**
     - adding CSS **class** to element to modify it

Next time I'll share some links on learning OOP or object-oriented programming in JS and how their classes work. There is a wealth of resources online and I can't hope to cover them all but I think these are pretty good and as always I'm open to any comments, critiques, or call outs.
