## Some things I Learned on my first week as a Dev

I recently started my first job as a web developer and I would like to share a few things I've learned. I'll format this as a list, so here we go!

### You belong
It doesn't matter if it's your first job or your latest role. You were hired because your employers believed in you. So do yourself a favor and believe in yourself too.

### Ask clarifying questions

If you don't understand something, your senior devs are not there to **judge** you, they are there to do their **job**. Part of which is to give and receive critique and help where they can. A gap in your knowledge base is not as embarrassing as not telling your lead when there is a problem.

### Volunteer but don't overreach

I suffer from a chronic need to prove myself. When things get too heavy on someone else's plate, you can help but don't overextend yourself if you know you've been given other directives to achieve. Your work takes priority!

### Google stuff first!

Yeah, this may feel like a bit of a no-brainer but some ask questions not about a codebase but about something that can be referenced easily. For example, if you don't know the name of an array method, you probably should look it up first.

### Function over perfection

We often talk about ideal conditions, greenfield projects, professional coding practices. However, nobody can write the cleanest code to begin with. Just focus on writing small, effective functions and remember to name your variables reasonably. New and old devs alike, have to rewrite things. Writing imperfect code, to begin with, is not a cardinal sin.

### You will fail but you're not your mistakes
I'm not trying to be disparaging but it happens. Things fall apart. Even senior devs make mistakes and there are always things you may miss or were not told because specifications were not available. It just happens. And I want to tell you that it's okay. We learn far more from our mistakes than our successes.

### Don't lose yourself in work
Ride a bike, play a video game, go on dates. You're a human before you're a developer and I know it's an exacting job. But that's the thing, it's a job. I do side projects but I also spend time with friends, do person stuff.

### Have fun!
I mean it. Enjoy the journey. Focusing on growth is fine but not at the cost of your personal relationships or health. We work to live not the reverse. And don't forget it!

### In closing

Sorry that this wasn't a technical blog but I feel that we tend to understate the importance of soft skills and emotional health. As always I welcome any comments, critiques, and feedback. Thanks for reading.
